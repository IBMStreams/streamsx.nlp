## How to integrate UIMA pear files

This guide helps you in the scenario, that you have a UIMA pear file and you need to know the supported annotation types.

The script `createTypes.pl` in `com.ibm.streamsx.nlp/bin` directory generates a file containing the annotation types as SPL types from the metadata of an UIMA pear file.
