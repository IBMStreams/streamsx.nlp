To submit a request, please open an issue with the following information:
* What version of Streams this release needs to support? - This allows us to see which branch we need to release from.
* A date when you need this release by - We will try our best to accommodate the date, but make promise.  This gives us an idea how urgent this request is.

Upon a request, a release proposal will be made.  In the release proposal, we will document the following information:
* Toolkit Version

* Release Notes to document What's New and Changed

We will build the release based on the proposal information.  Toolkit will following the Toolkit Versioning Guidelines as documented by IBMStreams Administration project.
