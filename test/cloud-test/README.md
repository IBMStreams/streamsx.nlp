# Setup for testing with Streaming Analytics service

## Before launching the test

Ensure that you have Python 3.5 installed. For example, you can get Python 3.5 from the [Anaconda archive page](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/index.html).

Ensure that the bin directory is added to the PATH environment variable. If necessary, add the bin directory by entering the following command on the command line:

    export PATH="~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

Ensure that you have set the following environment variables:

* `STREAMING_ANALYTICS_SERVICE_NAME` - name of your Streaming Analytics service
* `VCAP_SERVICES` - [VCAP](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/StreamingAnalytics/r_vcap_services.html#r_vcap_services) information in JSON format or a JSON file

Install the latest streamsx package with pip, a package manager for Python, by entering the following command on the command line:

    pip install --user --upgrade streamsx


### Starting a Streaming Analytics service
